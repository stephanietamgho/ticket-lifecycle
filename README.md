Go to the end user's osTicket website: http://localhost/osTicket/ and as an end user, click on "Open a new ticket".
</p>

</p>
<p>
Enter your full name, email address and your concers/request. Here for the purpose of the demo, Suzy Breeze is a user I created as an Agent in osTicket agent's site. She choses the subject topic, a summary and more detail of the issue she's encountering. Then she clicks on "Create Ticket".
</p>
<br />


<p><h2> ASSIGNMENT AND COMMUNICATION </h2></p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FAvGHoX.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="osTicket ticket assignment"/>
</p>
<p>
As the responding Agent, I log on osTicket's Agent portal.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Your screen will display all the tickets that were created by users. You can see one who's already assigned to John in Maintenance Department as created in the post installation tutorial. Let's open the one Suzy has just created that isn't currently assigned.
</p>

Here is Suzy's ticket in full view. Noone in the Support Team has been assigned this ticket yet. The Priority is set to Normal but will need to change to the severity of the issue. Due to thee nature of the issue, it was already determined as a SEV-A isuue with a SLA of 1 hour.

Here I'm assigning the ticket to Agent "Stephanie Tam" and updating it to "Emergency".
</p>

</p>
<p>
Upon making changes during the assignement phase, you may notice osticket created a thread with the updates made.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
During the communication phase, I, as the assigned Agent of this ticket, responds to the user, Suzy, to acknowledge her message and give her an update. 
</p>
<br />


<p><h2> WORKING THE ISSUE AND RESOLUTION </h2></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Upon investigation, the one of the load balancer was failing. Thus, I add another reply to the thread stating that the Sys Admin fixed the incident to update Ms. Suzy and the whole system. I then select "Resolved" to close the ticket.
</p>
<br />

Back to the main dashboard, we notice Suzy's ticket disappeared. It now appears on the "Closed" folder.
